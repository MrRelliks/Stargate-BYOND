# Stargate-BYOND
Source code for Stargate BYOND game - Please Fork this repository or give credit should you choose to use all or part of this code.

## Why Go Open Source?
I have been working on this source for a number of years. The game has improved as time has gone on but development is incredibly slow.
I would love to see the game finished but I just don't have the time to do it.

My hope is that someone will take the work we've done so far, improve upon it and bring a game to production that everyone can enjoy.

### Credits
* The game would have never had been started if not for the excellent work of the Stargate Online team, Whilst this source is 90% original, the gate code was made by them
(with some slight modifications by myself).

* A huge thank you to B4SSqontroller (remi) who throughout our time was an extremely talented Icon Artist. I couldn't have done it without him.

* A secondary thank you to DrTimeLord99 - He was a partner in the early days of SG:BYOND back when it was named Stargate Online (I wanted to try and bring the name back!)
